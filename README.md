# Goodnewssells.github.io

A web application built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I used three APIs for this project: Dandelion API, Plotly and Google News API. 

You get to choose your topic and then the news about this specific topic will be split and displayed in two columns: one for the 'positive news' and the other for the 'negatove news'
